## Preparing Your Presentation
1. **Know the paper**. You should be able to answer basic questions about the setup, data, and main results. If a question comes up that you cannot answer, say so plainly, but this should be the exception.
2. **Be selective with results**. Do not discuss every figure or table. Choose one or two results that you think are central to the paper’s contribution, and spend your time there.
3. **Explain why they matter.** For the results you choose, be clear about what they establish, what they rule out, and what remains ambiguous.
4. **Prioritize discussion**. Aim to spend roughly half the session on your own comments, doubts, extensions, or alternative interpretations. Treat the presentation as a launchpad for group discussion, not a lecture.

## Ground Rules
1. Participants are expected to attend sessions consistently to maintain continuity in discussions.
2. Participants should actively engage in discussions and contribute meaningfully to each session.
3. We will limit the use of devices during sessions to avoid distractions, except for note-taking or referencing relevant materials.
